# California_housing_prediction

Data was brough in from Kaggle that included housing data at a neighborhood granularity rather than at the individual home level. Once the data was read in, cleaning and an EDA were performed.

The data is split into a testing and training set. The models are fit on the training set and then predictions are created using the testing set and compared against the actual results. Linear regression, and lasso regression models are both fit and evaluated
