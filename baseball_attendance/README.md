# Baseball_Attendance

Data was collected about the MLB attendance for the Dodgers during the 2016 season. Variables include weekday, weather, and events such as fireworks. EDA is performed to get an understanding of trends and patterns in the data. A linear regression model is the fit to determine which factors had the biggest impact on high game attendance.
