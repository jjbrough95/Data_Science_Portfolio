# Loan_Approval_Prediction

Data collected from Kaggle is used to fit several models in an effort to predict whether or not a home loan will be approved by a financial institution. Variables include income, credit history, and loan amount. 

Logistic regression, random forest, and k nearest neighbor models are all fit to determine which model provides the most accurate predictions.

Each model is fit using a training split of the data. The models then create predictions based on the testing split and the predicted results are compared to the actual results using a confusion matrix.
