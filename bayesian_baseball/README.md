# Bayesian_baseball

Data is used from the 2016 MLB season. The data is subset into home and away games for each team. A prior distribution is set based on an assumption about runs per game. From there, the data is used to update the distribution and the prior and posterior distributions are plotted against each other. Predictions are created using the posterior distribution and a confidence interval is also created.
