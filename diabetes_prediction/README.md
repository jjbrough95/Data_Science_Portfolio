# Diabetes_prediction

The Pima Indian dataset from Kaggle was used for this project and is read into R from the file “diabetes.csv”. The data is cleaned by removing unnecessary columns, removing missing data, and changing variable datatypes. An EDA is then performed to explore trends and patterns within the dataset. 

The data is then split into a training and a test set. A logistic regression model is fit on the training data. The model is used to create predictions from the testing data. The predictions are compared against the actual outcome in a confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
