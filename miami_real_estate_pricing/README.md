Data collected from Kaggle is used to fit several models in an effort to predict property values based on a number of variables such as home and lot size, number of rooms, and location.

Linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and random forest regression are all fit to determine which model provides the most accurate predictions.

Hyperparameter tuning was then performed on the most accurate model in attempts to increase the accuracy of the predictions.
